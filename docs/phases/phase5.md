### Phase 5: Fancy Player (~2 days)
I will add playlist functionality to the player -- If you start playing a song
from a page with multiple songs, it will automatically load the next song from
that list when the previous song ends. I also plan on adding a link in the
persistent player to zoom to the part of the page where you started playing
music.
